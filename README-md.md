## My process
i created html file and a css file,i linked the css to html
i created a div of class content which contains all the content of project,another div of of class container which contains the first layer of the project,a div of class main which contains the second layer of the poject in side the div of main there is another div of class content-1 and content-2

in the css i gave a background color,font style,width,float and clear layout,hover.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Layout-The float and clear properties
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

i learnt how to make proper use of css layout-float and clear properties,where and how to apply margin and padding,how to use positioning 
overall i learnt how to create a grid view

To see how you can add code snippets, see below;

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.container {
  color: cyan;
}
```

### Continued development

i would love to continue working with grid and flex because i tried using flexbox at first but did not get it properly at first then i decided to try float and clear and was able to get it.i will love to use flex box in the future.
